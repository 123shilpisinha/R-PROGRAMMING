There are 5 basic classes of objects----character,integer,numeric,logical,complex
Most basic object is Vector
vector contains objects of same classes
list is an exception that contains objects of different classes.
for empty vector ,we can use----vector()
Numbers are treated as numeric classes.
If we explicitly want integer then we can use sufffix "L"
For eg---1L
NaN--Not a number
NA--Not available
