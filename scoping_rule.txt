Scoping rule tells that how value is bind to symbol.
first it search in global environment and then in each package on search list
global environment --- 1st elemnt
base package ---last element
when we search new package then it comes in 2nd position and other get shifted one step downward
There are 2 types of scooping----
LEXICAL--search in user's workspace
seaching sequence---function environment>>>parent environment>>>empty environment>>>error 
DYNAMIC---search where the function is defined
