c()---create vectors of objects
For eg---->x<-c(0.1,0.2)    #numeric
creating a vector can also be done by using vector()
For eg--->x<-vector("numeric",length=10)
If vector contains different classes then all are converted to smalller classes.ie,COECION happens
Coesion can also be done explicitly by using ----as.classname
For eg-->as.numeric
