[  ---returns object of same class and more than one object can be extracted
[[  --- extract element of list and data frames and output can be of different type
$  ---extract element by its name
for eg--
>x<-matrix(1:6,2,3)
>x[1,2]
[1]3
>x[1,]
[1] 1 3 5
note--drop=FALSE--is used to convert vector of length 1 to 1*1 matrix.
x$a---matches partially
x[["a"]]---matches exact
if we use exact=FALSE then   x[["a" ,exact=FALSE]]---matches partially
